# Tic_Tac_Toe
Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game, uisng the ruby programing langauge. I will be building this game out in three interations
- [ ] Version 1 - Basic 3x3 grid game with 2 human players
- [ ] Version 2 - Dynamic sized grid with 2 or more human players
- [ ] Version 3 - Dynamic sized grid with 2 or more human or computer players

### Version 1: Make it work
Version 1: Make it work
Gene design: for simplicity, in this first version I give the grid the dimensions of classic tic-tac-toe, 3x3. In later versions it will be refactored for a dynamic grid size.

Programmatically, I use a 2-dimensional array to present the grid. Players will have unique symbols for gameplay. I refer to those as marks. An empty position on the grid will be represented with an underscore ```'_'```. Below is an example of a grid:
```
[
    [:X, :O, '_'],
    [:O, :X, '_'],
    ['_', '_', :X],
]
```
To refer to a position of the grid, we'll use an array containing the row and column indices. For example, the position of the first row, second column would be ```[0, 1]```; this is the location of a ```:O```.
